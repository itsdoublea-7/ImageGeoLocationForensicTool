# Image Geo Location Forensic Tool
**Image GPS Forensics Tool** is a Python application built using the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) and the PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing. This tool allows users to analyze and visualize GPS metadata embedded in image files. Key features include:

- Session Management: Users can create, load, and save sessions to manage image data and analysis results efficiently.
- Map Visualization: Utilizes tkintermapview to display images on a map interface, providing a geographical context for the image data.
- Metadata Analysis: Extracts and displays EXIF metadata from image files, including GPS coordinates, timestamps, and location information.
- Filtering Options: Enables users to filter images based on date and location, facilitating targeted analysis.
- Interactive Display: Supports interactive image selection and display, with the ability to view full-sized images upon selection.

For the Map we have used the [**Tkintermapview**](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/TkinterMapView) package

This tool is useful for digital forensics investigations, geographic analysis, and visualizing spatial data embedded in image files.
